## About This Repository

This repository documents my hands-on lab work for the BRG-27 Infrastructure Systems Engineering Activity module at Murdoch University. Each folder corresponds to a lab session covering a core area of Linux administration, cloud infrastructure, and server management.

The labs progress from foundational Linux skills — setting up the environment, navigating the file system, managing services and permissions — through to real-world infrastructure topics such as cloud provisioning on AWS, DNS configuration, SSL certificates, and shell scripting automation.

All Linux lab work was performed on Ubuntu 24.04.4 LTS running natively on Windows 11 via WSL 2. Cloud labs were performed on Amazon Web Services (AWS) using the free tier. Each lab folder contains a written walkthrough of the steps taken, commands used, observations made, and reflections on what was learned. Screenshots are included as evidence of hands-on completion.

This repository also serves as preparation for the final video demonstration, where all lab work and key technical concepts will be presented and explained.

# Lab 1b — Familiarity with Ubuntu Linux

**Module:** BRG-27 ISEA  
**Day:** 1b  
**Status:** Completed

---

## Objective

Get hands-on with core Linux administration — from basic command line navigation through to managing services, users, firewalls, SSH, and file compression. The loopback address `127.0.0.1` was used to simulate a partner machine, which is common industry practice for testing network configurations locally before going live.

## Environment

| Component | Details |
|-----------|---------|
| OS | Ubuntu 24.04.4 LTS via WSL 2 |
| Shell | bash |
| Primary User | XiaoXuee |
| Simulated Partner | audrey_test (via 127.0.0.1) |

---

## Learning Objectives

- Navigate the Linux file system using basic CLI commands
- Install and configure Apache, SSH server, and firewall (UFW)
- Test web service accessibility over LAN
- Use nmap to detect open services and ports
- Use SSH and SCP for remote access and file transfer
- Create and manage users and understand privilege separation
- Compress and decompress files using tar and bzip2

---

## Part 1 — Basic Command Line Navigation

Practised moving around the Linux file system using `pwd`, `ls`, and `cd`. `pwd` confirmed the home directory at `/home/user`. `ls /etc` revealed the full collection of system configuration files. `cd ~` returned to home from any location.

![Navigation commands](lab-1b/01-navigation.png)

---

## Part 2 — Creating Files and Directories

Used `mkdir` and `touch` to create a working directory and files inside it. `ls -l` confirmed both files were created with `-rw-r--r--` permissions.

![mkdir and touch](lab-1b/02-mkdir-touch.png)

---

## Part 3 — Linux Directory Structure

Explored the three key system directories:

| Directory | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|
| `/etc` | System-wide configuration files — network, accounts, service configs |
| `/var` | Variable runtime data — logs, mail, spool, crash reports |
| `/home` | User home directories — personal files and settings per user |

![Directory structure](lab-1b/03-directory-structure.png)

---

## Part 4 — Manual Pages

Used `man ls` to explore the built-in documentation for the `ls` command. The man page shows every available flag and option without needing internet access.

![man ls](lab-1b/04-man-ls.png)

---

## Part 5 — CLI File Operations & System Info

Practised creating, copying, and viewing files. Checked system information using `uname -a`, `hostnamectl`, and `ps -e`. The process list confirmed services like `sshd`, `apache2`, and `systemd` were running.

![File ops and system info](lab-1b/05-file-ops-sysinfo.png)

---

## Part 6 — Super User & Permissions

Demonstrated privilege escalation with `whoami` and `sudo whoami`. Attempted `adduser` without sudo — it failed. With sudo it succeeded.

![sudo whoami](lab-1b/06-sudo-whoami.png)

---

## Part 7 — Install Apache and Test Web Access

Installed Apache using `sudo apt install apache2` and visited `http://127.0.0.1` in the browser to confirm the default page was live. Used `ip a` to determine the machine's IP address.

![Install Apache](lab-1b/install%20apache2.png)

![Install Apache 2](lab-1b/install%20apache2%202.png)

![ip a](lab-1b/ip%20a.png)

---

## Part 8 — Edit index.html and Share with Partner

Edited `/var/www/html/index.html` using nano to replace the default Apache page with a custom page — "Peer Page, Modified by Audrey Teo". Verified the content with `cat` then visited `http://127.0.0.1` in the browser to confirm the change was live.

![Editing index.html in nano](lab-1b/09-edit-indexhtml.png)

![cat index.html output](lab-1b/10-cat-indexhtml.png)

![Peer page in browser](lab-1b/Peer%20page.png)

---

## Part 9 — Scan Ports with Nmap and Remove Apache

Ran `nmap 127.0.0.1` to scan open ports — both port 22 (SSH) and port 80 (HTTP) showed as open with Apache running. Removed Apache and reran Nmap — port 80 disappeared, confirming that removing a service directly closes its port.

![Nmap scan with Apache running](lab-1b/07-nmap.png)

![Remove Apache and rerun Nmap](lab-1b/11-remove-apache-nmap.png)

---

## Part 10 — Enable UFW and Observe Service Access

Enabled UFW and allowed port 80. Observed that blocking port 80 via UFW prevented web access even with Apache running — showing the firewall and the service are independent security layers.

```bash
sudo ufw enable
sudo ufw allow 80
sudo ufw status
```

![UFW status](lab-1b/08-ufw-status.png)

---

## Part 11 — Attempt SSH and Troubleshoot with UFW Rules

Attempted SSH into the partner machine using the loopback address. Troubleshot connectivity issues by checking UFW rules and ensuring OpenSSH was allowed through the firewall.

```bash
sudo ufw allow OpenSSH
ssh audrey_test@127.0.0.1
```

![SSH login](lab-1b/SH%20login.png)

---

## Part 12 — Create a New User and SSH

Created a new user `audrey_test` using `sudo adduser` and SSH'd into the machine using that account to simulate connecting to a partner machine.

![Install SSH](lab-1b/install%20SSH%201.png)

![Install SSH 2](lab-1b/install%20SSH%202.png)

---

## Part 13 — Download Books Using wget

Downloaded books from Project Gutenberg using `wget` to practise retrieving files from the internet via the command line.

```bash
wget https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/11/pg11.txt
```

![wget download](lab-1b/13-wget.png)

---

## Part 14 — Create Directory, Move Files, Create tar Archive

Created a `books/` directory, moved downloaded files into it, and created a tar archive.

```bash
mkdir books
mv pg11.txt books/
tar -cvf books.tar books
```

![mkdir and tar](lab-1b/14-mkdir-tar.png)

---

## Part 15 — Compress, Decompress and Extract

Compressed the tar archive using `bzip2`, then decompressed and extracted it to verify the contents were intact.

```bash
bzip2 books.tar
ls -lh books.tar.bz2
bunzip2 books.tar.bz2
tar -xvf books.tar
```

![wget and bzip2 compression](lab-1b/wget%20bzip2.png)

---

## Challenge Activities

### Challenge 1 — Remote File Creation via SSH

SSH'd into `audrey_test` and created `remote_task.txt` remotely, confirming SSH gives full shell access to the remote machine.

![Remote file creation](lab-1b/touchremotetask.png)

### Challenge 2 — Remote GUI Apps via SSH

Attempted to launch `gedit` over SSH — it failed because `gedit` requires a display server. SSH provides terminal access only.

### Challenge 3 & 4 — SCP File Transfer

Used SCP to transfer a single file and recursively copy the entire `books/` directory to the partner machine.

```bash
scp hello.txt audrey_test@127.0.0.1:~/
scp -r books/ audrey_test@127.0.0.1:~/
```

![gedit fail and SCP](lab-1b/12-gedit-scp.png)

![SCP archive transfer](lab-1b/SCP%20transfer.png)

---

## Issues Encountered

| Issue | Resolution |
|-------|------------|
| `bzip2` not installed | Ran `sudo apt install bzip2 -y` |
| `gedit` failed over SSH | Expected — GUI apps require `ssh -X` for display forwarding |

---

## Outcome

- Navigated the Linux file system using `pwd`, `ls`, `cd`, `mkdir`, and `touch`
- Installed and tested Apache web server, edited `index.html` using nano
- Scanned open ports using Nmap before and after removing Apache — confirmed port 80 disappeared
- Configured UFW firewall rules and observed independent control over service accessibility
- Created a new user and SSH'd between accounts using the loopback address
- Downloaded files with `wget`, compressed with `tar` and `bzip2`, transferred with `scp`
- Demonstrated privilege escalation with `sudo` and discussed the principle of least privilege

---

## Reflection

Using `127.0.0.1` as a loopback to simulate a partner was a practical way to test SSH and SCP without needing a second machine. The Nmap exercise clearly showed that removing a service closes its port — a running service and a firewall rule are two independent controls. The gedit failure over SSH was a good reminder that servers are headless by default and all administration must be done through the terminal.

# Lab 2a — Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) Analysis

**Module:** BRG-27 ISEA  
**Day:** 2a  
**Status:** Completed

---

## Objective

Apply TCO methodology to a real-world procurement decision by comparing two printer models over a five-year period. The exercise required gathering manufacturer specifications, defining usage assumptions, calculating fixed and variable costs using a spreadsheet, and interpreting the results to make a justified recommendation.

---

## Environment

| Component | Details |
|-----------|---------|
| Tool | Microsoft Excel |
| Comparison Period | 5 Years |
| Printer A | Canon PIXMA G3020 (Ink Tank, Wireless, Print/Scan/Copy) |
| Printer B | HP LaserJet Pro M404n (Mono Laser, Network, Print Only) |
| Currency | SGD |

---

## Learning Objectives

- Define TCO and distinguish between fixed and variable costs
- Use spreadsheet formulas to calculate and compare total costs across printer types
- Define and document assumptions clearly and consistently
- Evaluate procurement decisions based on calculated TCO data
- Compare cost models for different usage scenarios

---

## Assumptions & Methodology

All costs were calculated using the assumptions below. Pricing was sourced from manufacturer spec sheets, Officeworks, and SP Group electricity rates.


![TCO Assumptions and Methodology](lab-2a/01-TOC1.png)

---

## TCO Spreadsheet — 5-Year Cost Comparison

The spreadsheet below documents every cost line item for both printers, using formulas to derive totals from the assumptions above.

![TCO Spreadsheet — Full Comparison](lab-2a/02-TOCO2.png)

---

## How Costs Were Calculated

The table below summarises the calculation method for each cost component side by side.

![Cost Calculation Breakdown](lab-2a/02-Cost3.png)

### Summary of Results

| Printer | 5-Year TCO |
|---------|-----------|
| Canon PIXMA G3020 | SGD $3,578.30 |
| HP LaserJet Pro M404n | SGD $9,217.00 |
| **Canon saves** | **SGD $5,638.70** |

The Canon PIXMA G3020 is significantly cheaper over five years. Its ink tank system costs a fraction of laser toner, and its 11W active power draw versus 380W for the HP means electricity costs are negligible by comparison. Even with contingency replacement units budgeted for both printers, Canon remains the more cost-effective choice. The HP M404n offers faster speeds (38 ppm vs 9 ipm) and suits mono-only, high-speed office environments where print speed and network reliability outweigh running costs.

---

## Reflection Questions

![Reflection Questions](lab-2a/02-Reflection%20Question4.png)

**Q1: Based on the TCO, which printer is the most cost-effective over 5 years?**

The Canon PIXMA G3020 is significantly cheaper. Its ink tank system costs a fraction of laser toner, and its 11W power draw versus 380W for the HP means electricity costs are negligible by comparison. Even with contingency replacement units included, Canon remains the more cost-effective choice.

**Q2: Would the answer change for a home user who prints only 5 pages per week?**

Yes. At 5 pages per week over 5 years, the total page count drops to 1,300 pages. The Canon ink bottles would last years without replacement. However, ink can dry up from inactivity — for very low usage a laser printer may actually be more practical despite a higher cost per page.

**Q3: What other non-financial factors could influence printer selection?**

Print speed (38 ppm HP vs 9 ipm Canon), mono versus colour capability, network connectivity, physical footprint, noise level, duty cycle, and ease of consumable replacement.

**Q4: What cost components are more significant for a large workgroup printer?**

For high-volume workgroups, toner or ink cost per page, drum replacement cycles, paper input capacity, duty cycle limits, and maintenance contracts become the dominant cost drivers.

**Q5: At what point (in years/pages) do the two printer options break even in cost?**

At 750 pages per week the HP never breaks even against the Canon — Canon is cheaper from day one. HP would only be competitive at very low print volumes where ink tank printers risk ink drying, or in environments requiring mono-only high-speed output where speed justifies the cost premium.
