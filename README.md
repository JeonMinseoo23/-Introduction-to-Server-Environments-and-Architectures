## About This Repository

This repository documents my hands-on lab work for the BRG-27 Infrastructure Systems Engineering Activity module at Murdoch University. Each folder corresponds to a lab session covering a core area of Linux administration, cloud infrastructure, and server management.

The labs progress from foundational Linux skills — setting up the environment, navigating the file system, managing services and permissions — through to real-world infrastructure topics such as cloud provisioning on AWS, DNS configuration, SSL certificates, and shell scripting automation.

All Linux lab work was performed on Ubuntu 24.04.4 LTS running natively on Windows 11 via WSL 2. Cloud labs were performed on Amazon Web Services (AWS) using the free tier. Each lab folder contains a written walkthrough of the steps taken, commands used, observations made, and reflections on what was learned. Screenshots are included as evidence of hands-on completion.

This repository also serves as preparation for the final video demonstration, where all lab work and key technical concepts will be presented and explained.

# Lab 1b — Familiarity with Ubuntu Linux

**Module:** BRG-27 ISEA  
**Day:** 1b  
**Status:** Completed

---

## Objective

Get hands-on with core Linux administration — from basic command line navigation through to managing services, users, firewalls, SSH, and file compression. The loopback address `127.0.0.1` was used to simulate a partner machine, which is common industry practice for testing network configurations locally before going live.

## Environment

| Component | Details |
|-----------|---------|
| OS | Ubuntu 24.04.4 LTS via WSL 2 |
| Shell | bash |
| Primary User | XiaoXuee |
| Simulated Partner | audrey_test (via 127.0.0.1) |

---

## Learning Objectives

- Navigate the Linux file system using basic CLI commands
- Install and configure Apache, SSH server, and firewall (UFW)
- Test web service accessibility over LAN
- Use nmap to detect open services and ports
- Use SSH and SCP for remote access and file transfer
- Create and manage users and understand privilege separation
- Compress and decompress files using tar and bzip2

---

## Part 1 — Basic Command Line Navigation

Practised moving around the Linux file system using `pwd`, `ls`, and `cd`. `pwd` confirmed the home directory at `/home/user`. `ls /etc` revealed the full collection of system configuration files. `cd ~` returned to home from any location.

![Navigation commands](lab-1b/01-navigation.png)

---

## Part 2 — Creating Files and Directories

Used `mkdir` and `touch` to create a working directory and files inside it. `ls -l` confirmed both files were created with `-rw-r--r--` permissions.

![mkdir and touch](lab-1b/02-mkdir-touch.png)

---

## Part 3 — Linux Directory Structure

Explored the three key system directories:

| Directory | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|
| `/etc` | System-wide configuration files — network, accounts, service configs |
| `/var` | Variable runtime data — logs, mail, spool, crash reports |
| `/home` | User home directories — personal files and settings per user |

![Directory structure](lab-1b/03-directory-structure.png)

---

## Part 4 — Manual Pages

Used `man ls` to explore the built-in documentation for the `ls` command. The man page shows every available flag and option without needing internet access.

![man ls](lab-1b/04-man-ls.png)

---

## Part 5 — CLI File Operations & System Info

Practised creating, copying, and viewing files. Checked system information using `uname -a`, `hostnamectl`, and `ps -e`. The process list confirmed services like `sshd`, `apache2`, and `systemd` were running.

![File ops and system info](lab-1b/05-file-ops-sysinfo.png)

---

## Part 6 — Super User & Permissions

Demonstrated privilege escalation with `whoami` and `sudo whoami`. Attempted `adduser` without sudo — it failed. With sudo it succeeded.

![sudo whoami](lab-1b/06-sudo-whoami.png)

---

## Part 7 — Install Apache and Test Web Access

Installed Apache using `sudo apt install apache2` and visited `http://127.0.0.1` in the browser to confirm the default page was live. Used `ip a` to determine the machine's IP address.

![Install Apache](lab-1b/install%20apache2.png)

![Install Apache 2](lab-1b/install%20apache2%202.png)

![ip a](lab-1b/ip%20a.png)

---

## Part 8 — Edit index.html and Share with Partner

Edited `/var/www/html/index.html` using nano to replace the default Apache page with a custom page — "Peer Page, Modified by Audrey Teo". Verified the content with `cat` then visited `http://127.0.0.1` in the browser to confirm the change was live.

![Editing index.html in nano](lab-1b/09-edit-indexhtml.png)

![cat index.html output](lab-1b/10-cat-indexhtml.png)

![Peer page in browser](lab-1b/Peer%20page.png)

---

## Part 9 — Scan Ports with Nmap and Remove Apache

Ran `nmap 127.0.0.1` to scan open ports — both port 22 (SSH) and port 80 (HTTP) showed as open with Apache running. Removed Apache and reran Nmap — port 80 disappeared, confirming that removing a service directly closes its port.

![Nmap scan with Apache running](lab-1b/07-nmap.png)

![Remove Apache and rerun Nmap](lab-1b/11-remove-apache-nmap.png)

---

## Part 10 — Enable UFW and Observe Service Access

Enabled UFW and allowed port 80. Observed that blocking port 80 via UFW prevented web access even with Apache running — showing the firewall and the service are independent security layers.

```bash
sudo ufw enable
sudo ufw allow 80
sudo ufw status
```

![UFW status](lab-1b/08-ufw-status.png)

---

## Part 11 — Attempt SSH and Troubleshoot with UFW Rules

Attempted SSH into the partner machine using the loopback address. Troubleshot connectivity issues by checking UFW rules and ensuring OpenSSH was allowed through the firewall.

```bash
sudo ufw allow OpenSSH
ssh audrey_test@127.0.0.1
```

![SSH login](lab-1b/SH%20login.png)

---

## Part 12 — Create a New User and SSH

Created a new user `audrey_test` using `sudo adduser` and SSH'd into the machine using that account to simulate connecting to a partner machine.

![Install SSH](lab-1b/install%20SSH%201.png)

![Install SSH 2](lab-1b/install%20SSH%202.png)

---

## Part 13 — Download Books Using wget

Downloaded books from Project Gutenberg using `wget` to practise retrieving files from the internet via the command line.

```bash
wget https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/11/pg11.txt
```

![wget download](lab-1b/13-wget.png)

---

## Part 14 — Create Directory, Move Files, Create tar Archive

Created a `books/` directory, moved downloaded files into it, and created a tar archive.

```bash
mkdir books
mv pg11.txt books/
tar -cvf books.tar books
```

![mkdir and tar](lab-1b/14-mkdir-tar.png)

---

## Part 15 — Compress, Decompress and Extract

Compressed the tar archive using `bzip2`, then decompressed and extracted it to verify the contents were intact.

```bash
bzip2 books.tar
ls -lh books.tar.bz2
bunzip2 books.tar.bz2
tar -xvf books.tar
```

![wget and bzip2 compression](lab-1b/wget%20bzip2.png)

---

## Challenge Activities

### Challenge 1 — Remote File Creation via SSH

SSH'd into `audrey_test` and created `remote_task.txt` remotely, confirming SSH gives full shell access to the remote machine.

![Remote file creation](lab-1b/touchremotetask.png)

### Challenge 2 — Remote GUI Apps via SSH

Attempted to launch `gedit` over SSH — it failed because `gedit` requires a display server. SSH provides terminal access only.

### Challenge 3 & 4 — SCP File Transfer

Used SCP to transfer a single file and recursively copy the entire `books/` directory to the partner machine.

```bash
scp hello.txt audrey_test@127.0.0.1:~/
scp -r books/ audrey_test@127.0.0.1:~/
```

![gedit fail and SCP](lab-1b/12-gedit-scp.png)

![SCP archive transfer](lab-1b/SCP%20transfer.png)

---

## Issues Encountered

| Issue | Resolution |
|-------|------------|
| `bzip2` not installed | Ran `sudo apt install bzip2 -y` |
| `gedit` failed over SSH | Expected — GUI apps require `ssh -X` for display forwarding |

---

## Outcome

- Navigated the Linux file system using `pwd`, `ls`, `cd`, `mkdir`, and `touch`
- Installed and tested Apache web server, edited `index.html` using nano
- Scanned open ports using Nmap before and after removing Apache — confirmed port 80 disappeared
- Configured UFW firewall rules and observed independent control over service accessibility
- Created a new user and SSH'd between accounts using the loopback address
- Downloaded files with `wget`, compressed with `tar` and `bzip2`, transferred with `scp`
- Demonstrated privilege escalation with `sudo` and discussed the principle of least privilege

---

## Reflection

Using `127.0.0.1` as a loopback to simulate a partner was a practical way to test SSH and SCP without needing a second machine. The Nmap exercise clearly showed that removing a service closes its port — a running service and a firewall rule are two independent controls. The gedit failure over SSH was a good reminder that servers are headless by default and all administration must be done through the terminal.

# Lab 2a — Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) Analysis

**Module:** BRG-27 ISEA  
**Day:** 2a  
**Status:** Completed

---

## Objective

Apply TCO methodology to a real-world procurement decision by comparing two printer models over a five-year period. The exercise required gathering manufacturer specifications, defining usage assumptions, calculating fixed and variable costs using a spreadsheet, and interpreting the results to make a justified recommendation.

---

## Environment

| Component | Details |
|-----------|---------|
| Tool | Microsoft Excel |
| Comparison Period | 5 Years |
| Printer A | Canon PIXMA G3020 (Ink Tank, Wireless, Print/Scan/Copy) |
| Printer B | HP LaserJet Pro M404n (Mono Laser, Network, Print Only) |
| Currency | SGD |

---

## Learning Objectives

- Define TCO and distinguish between fixed and variable costs
- Use spreadsheet formulas to calculate and compare total costs across printer types
- Define and document assumptions clearly and consistently
- Evaluate procurement decisions based on calculated TCO data
- Compare cost models for different usage scenarios

---

## Assumptions & Methodology

All costs were calculated using the assumptions below. Pricing was sourced from manufacturer spec sheets, Officeworks, and SP Group electricity rates.


![TCO Assumptions and Methodology](lab-2a/01-TOC1.png)

---

## TCO Spreadsheet — 5-Year Cost Comparison

The spreadsheet below documents every cost line item for both printers, using formulas to derive totals from the assumptions above.

![TCO Spreadsheet — Full Comparison](lab-2a/02-TOCO2.png)

---

## How Costs Were Calculated

The table below summarises the calculation method for each cost component side by side.

![Cost Calculation Breakdown](lab-2a/02-Cost3.png)

### Summary of Results

| Printer | 5-Year TCO |
|---------|-----------|
| Canon PIXMA G3020 | SGD $3,578.30 |
| HP LaserJet Pro M404n | SGD $9,217.00 |
| **Canon saves** | **SGD $5,638.70** |

The Canon PIXMA G3020 is significantly cheaper over five years. Its ink tank system costs a fraction of laser toner, and its 11W active power draw versus 380W for the HP means electricity costs are negligible by comparison. Even with contingency replacement units budgeted for both printers, Canon remains the more cost-effective choice. The HP M404n offers faster speeds (38 ppm vs 9 ipm) and suits mono-only, high-speed office environments where print speed and network reliability outweigh running costs.

# Lab 2b — Cloud Computing & Bash Scripting

**Module:** BRG-27 ISEA  
**Day:** 2b  
**Status:** Completed

---

## Objective

Launch and configure a cloud virtual machine on Microsoft Azure, install and serve content using Apache2, and demonstrate file management, network access, and remote connectivity. The lab was then extended with Bash scripting — writing and executing shell scripts for system information, loops, conditionals, and automated resource monitoring.

---

## Environment

| Component | Details |
|-----------|---------|
| Cloud Platform | Microsoft Azure |
| VM Name | my-vm |
| OS | Ubuntu 24.04.4 LTS |
| VM Size | Standard B2ats v2 (2 vCPUs, 1 GiB RAM) |
| Region | Central India (Zone 1) |
| Public IP | 98.70.33.154 |
| Local OS | Windows 11 |
| SSH Client | Windows Command Prompt (native SSH) |
| Username | azureuser |

---

## Learning Objectives

- Launch and configure a cloud VM on Microsoft Azure
- Configure Network Security Group rules to allow SSH and HTTP traffic
- Connect to a remote VM using SSH with a private key
- Install and verify the Apache2 web server
- Edit live web content using the nano text editor
- Transfer files remotely using wget, sudo cp, and scp
- Set file permissions using chmod
- Test network latency using ping
- Write and execute Bash scripts incorporating conditionals, loops, and system monitoring

---

## Part 1 — SSH into the Azure VM

The Azure VM was accessed from Windows Command Prompt using a private key downloaded from the Azure portal. The original key had not been saved at the time the VM was created, so it was reset through the Azure portal's Reset Password interface, which generated a new key pair and allowed the private key to be downloaded. The SSH command was then run specifying the key file path and the VM's public IP address. The terminal prompt changed to `azureuser@my-vm`, confirming a successful remote connection.

![SSH connected to Azure VM](lab-2a/01-ssh-connected.png)

---

## Part 2 — Update Package List

Before installing any software, the package index was updated to ensure all subsequent installations would pull the latest available versions from the Ubuntu repositories.

![apt update output](lab-2a/02-apt-update.png)

---

## Part 3 — Install Apache2

Apache2 was installed using the package manager. All dependencies were resolved and installed automatically, and the web server service was started immediately upon installation completion.

![Apache2 installation](lab-2a/03-apache-install.png)

---

## Part 4 — Configure Network Security Group

By default, only port 22 (SSH) was permitted in the Azure Network Security Group attached to the VM. A new inbound rule was created to allow HTTP traffic on port 80, which is required for the web server to be publicly accessible from a browser.

| Rule | Port | Protocol | Action |
|------|------|----------|--------|
| SSH | 22 | TCP | Allow |
| HTTP | 80 | TCP | Allow |

![Networking rules — NSG inbound rules](lab-2a/04-networking-rules.png)

---

## Part 5 — Verify Apache in Browser

The VM's public IP address was entered into a browser to confirm Apache2 was running and serving content. The default Ubuntu Apache2 welcome page loaded successfully, confirming the web server was live and the port 80 rule was working correctly.

![Apache2 default page in browser](lab-2a/05-apache-browser.png)

---

## Part 6 — Edit index.html Using Nano

The default Apache web page was opened in the nano text editor directly on the server. A custom heading was added to the HTML body to verify that edits to files in the web directory take effect immediately without requiring an Apache restart.

![index.html open in nano](lab-2a/06-edit-index.png)

---

## Part 7 — Replace index.html with Custom Page and Add Hyperlinks

The entire default Apache page was replaced with a clean custom HTML page. The new page included a heading, a descriptive paragraph, and a list of anchor tags linking to external resources — demonstrating the use of HTML hyperlinks served from a live cloud web server. The file was written directly to disk using a heredoc approach to avoid paste limitations encountered in the terminal session.

![Custom page with hyperlinks in browser](lab-2a/08-hyperlinks-browser.png)

---

## Part 8 — Download and Copy Files Using wget and sudo cp

A remote image file was downloaded to the VM using wget, then copied into the Apache web directory using sudo cp. This demonstrated how files can be retrieved from the internet directly on the server and placed into a publicly served directory without any local machine involvement.

![wget download and sudo cp output](lab-2a/09-wget-copy.png)

---

## Part 9 — Test Access from Mobile Device

The web server was accessed from a mobile phone browser using the same public IP address to confirm that the server was reachable across different devices and network types, verifying its public accessibility.

![Web server accessed from mobile browser](lab-2a/10-mobile-browser.png)

---

## Part 10 — Network Latency Testing with ping

The ping command was used to measure network latency from the VM to servers in three different geographic regions. All responses returned under 4ms, which reflects Google's globally distributed infrastructure — requests are automatically routed to the nearest available node regardless of the domain suffix used.

| Target | Average Latency |
|--------|----------------|
| google.com | 3.497 ms |
| google.co.jp | 3.072 ms |
| google.co.za | 3.170 ms |

![ping latency test results](lab-2a/11-ping-test.png)

---

## Part 11 — File Transfer Using SCP

A file was securely transferred from the local Windows machine to the Azure VM using SCP with the private key for authentication. This demonstrated an alternative method of getting files onto a remote server — pushing directly from the local machine rather than pulling from a remote URL.

![SCP file transfer output](lab-2a/12-scp-transfer.png)

---

## Part 12 — Set File Permissions Using chmod

Restrictive permissions were applied to the private key file using chmod 600, ensuring only the file owner can read or write it. The result was confirmed using ls -la, which returned `-rw-------` — the standard required permission level for SSH private keys. If a key file has broader permissions, SSH will refuse to use it as a security measure.

![chmod 600 and ls -la output](lab-2a/13-chmod.png)

---

## Part 13 — Bash Lab: Navigate File System and Manage Files

### Directory Creation and Navigation

A working directory structure was created for the Bash scripting exercises. A main lab directory was created, then two subdirectories — one for scripts and one for documentation — were created inside it. The ls command was used to confirm the structure was in place.

![mkdir and directory navigation](lab-2a/14-mkdir-navigate.png)

### File Operations

Core file management commands were practised by creating a new file, copying it under a different name, and renaming the copy using the move command. Listing the directory contents afterwards confirmed all three operations completed successfully.

![File operations — touch, cp, mv, ls](lab-2a/14b-file-commands.png)

---

## Part 14 — Bash Script: hello_world.sh

A basic shell script was written and saved using nano. It opened with the shebang line to specify the Bash interpreter, then used echo to print a greeting, and command substitution to dynamically display the hostname and current date and time at runtime. The script was made executable by changing its permissions, then run directly from the terminal. The output confirmed all three lines printed correctly with live system values.

![hello_world.sh execution output](lab-2a/15-hello-world-run.png)

---

## Part 15 — Bash Script: system_info.sh

A more structured script was written incorporating a for loop to produce a countdown from three to one, the read command to accept interactive input from the user, and an if/elif/else conditional block to evaluate what was typed and return an appropriate response. When run with the name "Audrey", the script completed the countdown and returned a personalised greeting — confirming the loop and conditional logic both functioned as expected.

![system_info.sh execution output](lab-2a/16-system-info-run.png)

---

## Part 16 — Bash Script: resource_monitor.sh

A resource monitoring script was written that first asks the user how many monitoring cycles to run, then loops through each cycle — displaying memory usage, disk usage, and CPU load at each iteration with a two-second pause between checks. Running the script with two iterations showed memory at 419Mi used of 846Mi total, disk at 8% used, and CPU idle above 88%, confirming the server was running well within its resource limits.

![resource_monitor.sh execution output](lab-2a/17-resource-monitor-run.png)

## Reflection Questions

**What were the benefits of cloud deployment over local virtualisation?**

Cloud deployment removes the need for dedicated local hardware. The VM was provisioned within minutes, accessible from any device with a network connection, and could be stopped when idle to avoid unnecessary charges. Local virtualisation requires a capable host machine and is not remotely accessible without additional configuration.

**How does Apache serve files, and how did you verify this?**

Apache listens on port 80 for incoming HTTP requests and serves files from the `/var/www/html/` directory. Verification was done by accessing the VM's public IP in a browser and confirming the correct page loaded — both the default page and the modified custom page — reflecting changes made directly to the files on the server.

**What did you learn about file ownership and permissions?**

The chmod command controls who can read, write, or execute a file. Setting a file to 600 restricts access to the owner only. This is the required permission for SSH private keys — if the key file is readable by other users, SSH will reject it as a security risk.

**What risks are associated with leaving instances running?**

A running VM continues to accumulate compute charges even when no work is being performed on it. It also remains exposed to the internet, which increases the attack surface. Azure's auto-shutdown feature was configured to power down the VM at 7:00 PM UTC daily to address both concerns.

**How would you explain the difference between DNS and /etc/hosts to a client?**

DNS is a globally distributed system that resolves domain names to IP addresses across the internet. The /etc/hosts file is a local override on each individual machine — entries in it take precedence over DNS for that machine only. It is commonly used in development or testing environments to point a domain name to a local or staging server without modifying public DNS records.

**What is the purpose of the shebang line in a Bash script?**

The shebang line at the top of a script tells the operating system which interpreter to use when the script is executed directly. Without it, the system may not know which shell to invoke and the script may not run as intended.

**What does the free command show?**

It displays current memory usage in a human-readable format, including total RAM, amount in use, amount free, shared memory, buffer and cache usage, and the amount available for new processes. On this VM it showed 846Mi total RAM with 419Mi in use.

**How would you monitor network bandwidth in a Bash script?**

By reading from the /proc/net/dev file, which contains cumulative bytes transmitted and received per network interface. Sampling this file at regular intervals and calculating the difference between readings gives a real-time bandwidth figure without requiring additional tools to be installed.
